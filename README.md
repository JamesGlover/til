# TIL

> Today I Learned

A repository of short notes and code snippets categorized by language, platform
or software. I'll also try and use this as a more general knowledge repo, adding
in some of the more useful tips and tricks, or obscure bits of knowledge I've
picked up over time.

Inspired by [Josh Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) who was in turn
inspired by [Thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til).

Maintained using the [til-rb](https://github.com/pjambet/til-rb/) gem.
